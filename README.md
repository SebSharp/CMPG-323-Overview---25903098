## Branching Strategies
The branching strategy I will be using is <tt>GitFlow</tt>

GitFlow might be more complex and advanced for most modern projects, however it enables parallel development allowing for developers to work separately from the master branch on features where a feature branch is created from the master branch.

The moment changes are completed, developers then merge the changes into the master branch for release.

This strategy consists of the following branches:

- Master 
- Develop
- Feature: Features that branches off the develop branch 
- Release: Help prepare a new production release
- Hotfix: Branches arise from a bug that has been discovered and must be resolved

The main and develop branches are considered to be the main branches, with an infinite lifetime, while the rest are supporting branches that are meant to aid parallel development among developers, usually short-lived.
